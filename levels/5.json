    "Hey, welcome! In this level we are going to show you the mystery of the 'or' operator!",
    "We have A set up in the premise, but we need to show that the value of A is unknown (neither proven or disproven). How can we do this?",
    "Our friend 'or' operator is here to help! An expression 'A ∨ B' (also known as a logical disjunction of A and B) does not entail anything about A and B in and of itself.",
    "Thinking of it as 'I know that one of A and B is true (or maybe both), but I need more information to deduce which is true. Hence both of them are undecidable.'",
    "Notice that ∨ is commutative. That is, 'A ∨ B' and 'B ∨ A' are equivalent!"
