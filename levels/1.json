    "Imagine the premises being the \"knowledge that you have\", and the handcards being \"the material that I can use to change the knowledge that I have\".",
    "Your goal is to play your hand cards to the premises to formulate a logical proof which entails all the expected goals shown at the bottom.",
    "Click on the hand card \"A\" to select this card. After that, click the green placeholder to play the selected card to the premise.",
